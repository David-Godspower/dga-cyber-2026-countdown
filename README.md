# 🎆 DGA Cyber 2026 Countdown

> A futuristic, interactive New Year's Eve celebration experience built with HTML5 Canvas, Web Audio API, and vanilla JavaScript.

**Created by:** David Godspower Ajala (D.G.A.)

## 🚀 About The Project
This project creates a "Cyberpunk/Glitch" aesthetic countdown timer that transitions into an interactive fireworks display. It is designed to be lightweight (single file) yet visually stunning, featuring custom particle physics and synthesized sound effects.

## 🌟 Features

* **Cyberpunk Aesthetic:** Neon visuals, glitch text effects, and "hacker" typewriter animations.
* **Physics Engine:** Custom gravity and friction logic for realistic firework particles.
* **Web Audio API:** Synthesized sound effects for explosions, launches, and UI interactions (no external audio files required).
* **Interactive:** Click or tap anywhere to launch fireworks manually.
* **Responsive:** Auto-resizes to fit mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
* **Control Panel:** Adjustable volume, mute toggle, and pause/resume functionality.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5 Canvas:** For high-performance rendering of particles.
* **CSS3:** For animations, glowing text, and layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For the logic, physics engine, and audio synthesis.
